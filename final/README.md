# Welcome to my last assingment!

We have a basic schema for this project like this;

![Schema](https://github.com/atarikaltunn/Kofana-Patikadev-Bootcamp/blob/main/final/images/schema.png)

Our aim in this project is learning the salesforce environment and gaining some practices which I could not able to manage. :(

- I have completed the 1st and 2nd sections in project.
- I have tried to improve 3rd section but I have failed to implement process builder into the project.
- In 5,6,7th sections, I could not handle how to use my objects in developer console. Because of my limited time, I could not take it to the next step.
- I have readed about apex databases ,triggers, schedulers bu tI did not have enough time to implement them.



It was nice to meet with you Kofana and Patika...
